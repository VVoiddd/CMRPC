# CMRPC

Change My Rich Custom Presence (CMRPC) is a tool that automatically updates your Discord Rich Presence with user avatars and custom messages when someone joins your server and sends a message.

## Features

- Automatically updates Discord Rich Presence with the user's avatar and custom message.
- Kicks users after they send a message and deletes the message.
- Uses Discord's CDN links to display user avatars.
- Includes a customizable button in the Rich Presence.

## Configuration

- `hidden_channel_id`: The ID of the hidden channel where the bot uploads user avatars.
- `owner_id`: The ID of the owner who is not affected by the bot's actions.
